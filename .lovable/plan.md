## Remove "Enterprise" from Bio

A simple text update to the About page bio.

### Change

**File:** `src/pages/About.tsx`

**Current (line ~140):**
```
Enterprise Salesforce implementations through CloudRoute (ISV Partner). HubSpot and lighter stacks direct.
```

**Updated:**
```
Salesforce implementations through CloudRoute (ISV Partner). HubSpot and lighter stacks direct.
```

This removes "Enterprise" while keeping the CloudRoute partnership and platform structure intact.
