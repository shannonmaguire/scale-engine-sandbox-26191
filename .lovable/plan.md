## Diagnostic Page Rebuild: From Generic Consultant to Category A Authority

### Current Problems Identified

**Structure & Length:** 6 sections across multiple viewports. Feels padded and consultant-standard. Compare to Home (4 tight sections) and About (5 purpose-built sections).

**Language Issues:**
- "System Health Report" + "Benchmark comparison" + "maturity scoring" = consultant jargon, not failure modes
- "What's Included" lists deliverables (how consultants sell) not consequences (how architects sell)
- Process timeline reads like a generic 2-week sprint, not a diagnostic discipline
- "Do Not Book If" uses internal language ("Addicted to optionality") rather than recognizable buyer behavior

**Missing Authority Signals:**
- No proof point or case study on the entry page
- No price signal ($2,000) to anchor qualification
- No Category A validation language

**CTA Redundancy:** Hero CTA + Final section CTA with near-identical copy. Home has hero + one secondary, About has one strategic placement.

### Rebuild Approach

**Structure: Compress to 5 tight sections (fit one viewport scroll)**

1. **Hero** (with system-status badge)
   - Positioning line
   - H1: "Find Out What's Breaking"
   - Single supporting line: VoC-grounded consequence (not feature list)
   - Single CTA: "Book Diagnostic"

2. **Exclusion Framework** (variant="muted")
   - `Do Not Book If` section with **buyer behavior** instead of jargon
   - Example: "Nothing built yet" + "You're comparing on price" + "You want validation"
   - Keep destructive styling but rewrite signals to match Home's binary language

3. **Qualification Patterns** (Keep, but tighten)
   - Keep the 6 VoC patterns (DATA GOVERNANCE, INTEGRATION, etc.)
   - These are Category A validation language
   - Compress grid to more visual density

4. **What You'll Know** (replaces "What's Included")
   - Consequence-based framing: "After the diagnostic, you'll know..."
   - 3 bullets max: What's broken | What it costs | What to fix first
   - Tie each to a failure mode (not a deliverable)

5. **Book Your Diagnostic** CTA (variant="muted")
   - Price signal ($2,000) visible on page
   - Final outcome anchor: "2 weeks. You'll know what's broken."
   - Single button

**Tone Shift:**
- Remove all consultant deliverable language
- Replace with consequence language (e.g., "You can't see in dashboards" not "bottleneck mapping")
- Match the direct, operator voice of Home + About

**Technical Details:**
- Rewrite exclusion list to use Category A buyer language (no jargon)
- Keep qualification patterns but enhance copy
- Remove "Process Timeline" section entirely (it's not buying signal, it's consultant theater)
- Remove "Outcomes" section entirely (step-up structure doesn't belong on diagnostic entry page; that lives on Contact/post-conversation)
- Remove double CTAs; use single strategic placement
- Add $2,000 price anchor somewhere visible

**Result:** Page compresses from ~6,500px to ~3,500px (single viewport scroll area), matches Home/About structure, uses Category A language throughout, and increases qualification precision by removing explanation scaffolding.
