# Chat-to-Blog Workflow

## How It Works

You share content with me in chat (raw text, transcripts, notes, ideas), and I'll:

1. **Transform** it into a polished blog article with proper structure
2. **Generate** metadata (excerpt, tags, read time, category)
3. **Insert** it directly into the database
4. **Publish** it immediately (or save as draft if you prefer)

## The Process

## What I Need From You

For each blog post, give me:

1. **Raw content** - Paste your text, transcript, notes, or bullet points
2. **Topic/angle** - What's the main point? (optional - I can infer it)
3. **Category** - One of: Revenue Infrastructure, System Installation, Fractional Ops, Salesforce Ecosystem, Revenue Operations, Resources
4. **Publish now?** - Yes/No (defaults to yes)

---

## About the Transcript You Shared

That meeting transcript is great internal documentation, but it's not really blog content - it's a private team discussion about operations, credentials, and hosting.

If you want to turn it into a blog post, we could extract themes like:
- "Why Every RevOps Client Needs a Password Manager"
- "Domain Management: Controlling Your Marketing Assets"
- "Setting Operational Boundaries with Clients"

---

## Ready to Start?

Just paste your content and tell me what you want the article to be about. For example:

> "Here's my content for a blog post about why we require password managers from clients before starting work: [your notes/ideas]"

Or for the Resources articles:

> "Here's the content for the 90-Day Roadmap Template resource: [paste the text from your PDF or write it out]"

I'll handle the rest - formatting, structure, metadata, and database insertion.
