## Core Positioning

### Primary Positioning Statement
"Revenue infrastructure that works in 90-day cycles with fixed scope, documented handoff, and zero vendor lock-in."

### Who We Are
- **Industry:** Revenue Operations consulting studio
- **Focus:** Fixed-scope implementation over ongoing retainers
- **Differentiation:** Systems you own (not rent), documented handoffs, 90-day delivery cycles
- **Sweet Spot:** $2M-$50M ARR B2B companies with breaking revenue systems

### Who We're Not
- Traditional consulting firms (no time-and-materials billing)
- Long-term retainer agencies (we build, document, hand off)
- Salesforce ISV partners (we're implementation-focused, not reselling)
- Generic RevOps consultants (we specialize in technical system installation)

### Target Audience States
Always segment by **current state**, not ideal state:

1. **Breaking:** Systems actively failing, team frustrated, forecast inaccurate
   - Need: Immediate diagnosis → Assessment
   - Pain: Revenue infrastructure hurting business right now

2. **Planning:** Researching options, building internal case, need proof
   - Need: Frameworks and proof → Resources
   - Pain: Can't justify budget without ROI validation

3. **Selling:** AEs/partners working Salesforce services deals
   - Need: Technical support and delivery capacity → Partner Hub
   - Pain: Can't scope or deliver complex technical work

## Service Descriptions

### Assessment (2 weeks, fixed fee, 100% credit to Sprint)

**Short description:**
"Technical audit of your revenue infrastructure. We score 6 dimensions (Data Quality, Automation, Integration, Governance, Reporting, Adoption), benchmark against peer companies, and deliver a prioritized 90-day roadmap."

**When to use:**
- You can describe symptoms but not root causes
- Past projects delivered "on time" but didn't fix the issue
- You're debating build vs. buy without baseline documentation
- Multiple consultants gave conflicting recommendations

**Deliverables:**
- Technical assessment report (objective scoring, not self-reported)
- Competitive benchmark vs. similar-stage companies
- 90-day implementation roadmap with sprint sequencing
- 100% fee credit toward first Sprint engagement

**Timeline:** 2 weeks from kickoff to delivery

---

### Sprint (90 days, fixed scope, documented handoff)

**Short description:**
"Fixed-scope implementation delivered in 90-day cycles. We install one major system capability per sprint—automation, integration, reporting infrastructure—with weekly milestones and documented handoff."

**When to use:**
- You know what's broken and have budget to fix it
- You need working functionality by a specific deadline (quarter-end, board meeting, etc.)
- You want systems you own, not vendor dependencies

**Deliverables:**
- Working system functionality shipped by Day 90
- Full technical documentation (architecture, workflows, data models)
- Team training and knowledge transfer
- Handoff SOP (you maintain it or we support it—your choice)

**Timeline:** 90 days per sprint, typically 1-3 sprints per engagement

**Pricing model:** Fixed scope (not time-and-materials)

---

### Fractional Ops (ongoing, month-to-month, post-Sprint only)

**Short description:**
"Ongoing revenue operations support after Sprint completion. Month-to-month contracts, 10-20 hours/week, focused on optimization and scaling—not firefighting."

**When to use:**
- Systems are working but need ongoing tuning
- You're scaling (adding reps, regions, products)
- You want senior RevOps talent without full-time hire

**Requirements:**
- Must complete Sprint engagement first (we don't do Fractional before systems are stable)
- Systems must be documented and owned by your team

**What we do:**
- Optimize existing workflows based on usage data
- Support scaling (new rep onboarding, territory expansion)
- Monthly system health reviews

**What we don't do:**
- Emergency firefighting (systems must be stable)
- Greenfield builds (that's Sprint work)
- Long-term retainers (month-to-month only)

---

### Web Systems (6-8 weeks, fixed scope, full ownership)

**Short description:**
"Revenue-focused websites built as infrastructure—not marketing collateral. Site architecture designed for lead capture, qualification, and routing. Component library, CMS handoff, and full documentation so you own it."

**When to use:**
- Your website isn't capturing or qualifying leads effectively
- You're locked into a vendor for simple content updates
- You need systems that integrate with CRM/attribution tools

**Deliverables:**
- Site architecture (optimized for lead capture → qualification → routing)
- Custom component library (reusable, documented, maintainable)
- Handoff SOP (domain, hosting, CMS, analytics—zero vendor dependency)
- Optional: Support retainer post-launch

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks from kickoff to launch

---

## Key Phrases & Terminology

### Core Operating Phrases
Use these exact phrases consistently across all content:

1. **"Fixed scope"**
   - NOT "fixed price" or "flat fee"
   - Emphasizes defined deliverables, not just cost model

2. **"90-day cycles"**
   - NOT "quarterly sprints" or "three-month projects"
   - Reinforces predictable cadence

3. **"Documented handoff"**
   - NOT "knowledge transfer" or "training"
   - Emphasizes ownership transfer, not just education

4. **"Systems you own (not rent)"**
   - NOT "we don't do retainers" or "no vendor lock-in"
   - Positive framing (ownership) vs. negative (avoiding lock-in)

5. **"Revenue infrastructure"**
   - NOT "revenue operations tools" or "RevOps stack"
   - Positions as foundational, not tactical

6. **"Technical debt"**
   - Use for Salesforce cleanup work
   - NOT "system cleanup" or "CRM optimization"

7. **"Forecast accuracy"**
   - Primary metric for Salesforce health
   - NOT "pipeline visibility" or "reporting quality"

8. **"100% fee credit to Sprint"**
   - Assessment pricing model
   - Always include "to Sprint" (not just "credit")

### System Health Terminology

**Use consistently when describing system states:**

- **Breaking:** Systems actively failing, blocking revenue
- **Messy:** Systems functional but inefficient
- **Optimized:** Systems supporting scale

**Avoid vague terms:**
- ❌ "Not working well"
- ❌ "Could be better"
- ❌ "Needs improvement"
- ✅ Use specific metrics: "Forecast accuracy below 75%", "Deal velocity declining quarter-over-quarter"

### Service Language Patterns

**Assessment language:**
- "Diagnose before surgery"
- "Objective scoring, not self-reported"
- "Benchmark against peer companies"
- "Prioritized by ROI, not urgency"

**Sprint language:**
- "Working functionality by Day 90"
- "Weekly milestones with go/no-go checkpoints"
- "No Phase 2 dependencies"
- "Ship something, then iterate"

**Fractional language:**
- "Optimization, not firefighting"
- "Month-to-month, not locked contracts"
- "Post-Sprint only" (emphasize prerequisite)

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Overall Voice
**Direct. Technical. No fluff.**

- Write like a senior RevOps engineer briefing a CRO
- Short sentences. Active voice. No marketing jargon.
- Lead with outcome, then explain approach
- Quantify claims whenever possible

### Tone by Content Type

**Website copy:**
- Confident but not arrogant
- Technical but accessible (explain jargon when needed)
- Problem-focused before solution-focused
- Example: "Your Salesforce instance has 47 automation rules. 31 are inactive. 8 conflict. That's why forecast accuracy is below 70%."

**Blog posts:**
- Authoritative with specific examples
- Use case studies and real metrics
- Structure: Problem → Why it happens → How to fix → What changes
- Example titles: "What Breaks First in $2-5M ARR Companies", "Salesforce Technical Debt as Competitive Intelligence"

**Email nurture:**
- Personal (from Shannon)
- Educational, not sales-y
- Email 1: What you downloaded + why it matters
- Email 2: How to tell if you have this problem
- Email 3: If you want it done, start Assessment

**Resource descriptions:**
- Outcome-focused first sentence
- Use case in second sentence
- Format/structure in third sentence
- Example: "Calculate how Salesforce cleanup saves pipeline risk over 12 months. Input your current metrics, get projected ROI with cost/benefit breakdown. Excel-based calculator with scenario modeling."

### Writing Patterns

**Problem → Solution structure:**
```
Most [audience] [symptom] because [root cause].

This costs [quantified impact].

The fix: [specific solution].
```

Example:
"Most revenue leaders know Salesforce is 'messy' but can't justify cleanup budget without ROI proof. This costs $280K-$450K/year in lost pipeline velocity for a $5M ARR company. The fix: Run the ROI Calculator using actual pipeline numbers."

**Before/After pattern:**
```
Before: [symptom]
After: [outcome]
Timeline: [duration]
```

Example:
"Before: Manual lead routing, 40% assignment errors, 3-day SLA
After: Automated qualification + routing, <2% errors, same-day SLA
Timeline: 90-day Sprint"

---

## Value Propositions

### Primary Value Prop by Service

**Assessment:**
"Know exactly what's broken before spending $100K+ on implementation."

**Sprint:**
"Working systems in 90 days with full documentation—so you own them."

**Fractional:**
"Senior RevOps talent without full-time hire after systems are stable."

**Web Systems:**
"Websites that capture and route leads—not just display content."

### Differentiators (Why CWT vs. competitors)

**vs. Traditional consulting firms:**
- "Fixed scope vs. time-and-materials billing"
- "You own the systems vs. ongoing vendor dependency"
- "90-day delivery vs. 6-12 month projects"

**vs. Fractional RevOps consultants:**
- "We build infrastructure, they optimize existing systems"
- "Sprint → handoff → optional Fractional (we sequence it)"
- "Fixed deliverables vs. ongoing advising"

**vs. Salesforce ISV partners:**
- "Implementation-focused vs. reselling licenses"
- "Platform-agnostic recommendations vs. Salesforce-first bias"
- "Documented handoff vs. ongoing support contracts"

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have a Salesforce consultant."

**Response framework:**
"Most consultants optimize existing workflows. We rebuild broken infrastructure—then hand it off. If your current consultant can document your entire revenue system in a handoff SOP, you don't need us. If they can't, that's the problem."

**When to use:** Prospect has existing vendor relationship

---

### "We need this done in 30 days, not 90."

**Response framework:**
"30-day projects skip foundation work. You'll ship something that breaks by Day 45. Our 90-day sprints include Week 1-2 (foundation), Week 3-10 (build), Week 11-12 (handoff + documentation). You can't compress foundation."

**When to use:** Prospect wants faster timeline

---

### "Can we do ongoing support instead of Sprint?"

**Response framework:**
"Ongoing support only works if systems are documented and stable. We don't do Fractional before Sprint for the same reason you don't hire a personal trainer before learning to walk. Build → Document → Handoff → then Optimize."

**When to use:** Prospect wants retainer without implementation

---

### "Your pricing is higher than [competitor]."

**Response framework:**
"You're comparing implementation cost to consulting hours. Our Sprint includes the system build AND full documentation AND handoff. Their hours don't include knowledge transfer—so you're locked in. Calculate total cost over 12 months, not just project fee."

**When to use:** Price objection based on hourly rate comparison

---

### "We're not sure if we need Assessment or Sprint."

**Response framework:**
"If you can list your top 3 system issues AND estimate ROI for fixing each, skip Assessment. If you're debating what to fix first or can't quantify impact, start with Assessment. The 100% fee credit means Assessment is free if you do Sprint."

**When to use:** Service selection confusion

---

## Writing Patterns

### Headlines

**Problem-focused headlines:**
- "Why Most Salesforce Projects Fail by Week 6"
- "The $280K Cost of Messy CRM Data"
- "What Breaks First in $2-5M ARR Companies"

**Outcome-focused headlines:**
- "From 40% Forecast Accuracy to 85% in 90 Days"
- "How to Own Your Revenue Systems (Not Rent Them)"
- "Turn Assessment Findings into Working Systems"

**How-to headlines:**
- "How to Tell if Salesforce Debt is Costing You Deals"
- "How to Qualify Technical Scope in Discovery Calls"
- "How to Take Full Ownership from Any Vendor"

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Patterns

**Primary CTAs:**
- "Start Assessment" (NOT "Book Assessment" or "Schedule Assessment")
- "Browse Resources" (NOT "Download Resources")
- "Apply for Partnership" (NOT "Become a Partner")

**Secondary CTAs:**
- "View Case Studies" → /proof
- "Read the Blog" → /blog
- "Talk to Shannon" → /contact

**CTA copy patterns:**
```
[Primary action]
[Timeline/commitment level]
```

Examples:
- "Start Assessment — 2-week turnaround • 100% fee credits to Sprint"
- "Start Sprint — 90 days to working system • Fixed scope"
- "Browse Resources — Instant download • No credit card"

### Credibility Markers

**Use these formats for social proof:**

**Metrics:**
- "18-25% improvement in forecast accuracy within 90 days"
- "Used by RevOps teams at 100+ B2B companies"
- "2,847 downloads" (Resource library)
- "$2M-$50M ARR companies" (Target market)

**Case study format:**
- Industry + Problem → Solution → Outcome
- Example: "SaaS company, $8M ARR. Manual lead routing causing 40% assignment errors. Implemented automated qualification + routing. Result: <2% errors, same-day SLA."

**Testimonial format:**
- Quote → Title → Company stage (NOT company name unless approved)
- Example: "The Technical Assessment Framework caught 3 critical gaps our consultant missed." — Director of Revenue Operations, B2B SaaS, 200+ employees

## Content Reuse Strategy

### Modular Content Blocks

Create content in reusable modules that can be mixed/matched:

**Service overview block:**
```
[Service Name] ([Timeline], [Pricing Model])
[One-sentence description]
[When to use - 3 bullets]
[Deliverables - 3-4 bullets]
[Timeline detail]
```

**Problem/Solution block:**
```
Most [audience] [symptom] because [root cause].
You have this problem if: [3-4 specific indicators]
What this costs: [quantified impact]
The fix: [specific solution]
```

**Case study block:**
```
[Industry/Company stage]
Before: [3 symptoms]
After: [3 outcomes]
Timeline: [duration]
```

### Canonical Metrics

**Use these exact numbers consistently:**

- Assessment turnaround: "2 weeks from kickoff to delivery"
- Assessment credit: "100% fee credit toward first Sprint engagement"
- Sprint duration: "90 days per sprint"
- Forecast accuracy improvement: "18-25% improvement within 90 days"
- Target market: "$2M-$50M ARR B2B companies"
- Resource downloads: "2,847 downloads" (update quarterly)
- System health dimensions: "6 dimensions" (Data Quality, Automation, Integration, Governance, Reporting, Adoption)

## Voice of Customer Patterns

### Extracted Buyer Language (from discovery calls)

Use these exact phrases when describing client pain points:

**Data Problems:**
- "CSV uploads to Salesforce. Zero validation."
- "Asset records don't match vendor records."
- "Serial numbers in Salesforce don't tie back to anything."
- "Products are in Salesforce, QuickBooks, and a spreadsheet."

**Integration Gaps:**
- "Apple, Stripe, QuickBooks—none of them talk to each other."
- "Manual reconciliation takes 15 hours a week."
- "Finance trusts nothing from Salesforce."

**Access Chaos:**
- "Everyone uses the same login."
- "Who has access? Nobody knows."
- "Former contractor still has Salesforce access."

**Partner/Channel:**
- "Deals get registered. Then silence."
- "AE can't scope the technical work."
- "Pipeline stalls after the introduction."

**Tool Selection:**
- "We went with Trello because someone used it before."
- "Nobody evaluated whether it was the right tool."
- "Decisions made by familiarity, not architecture."

### Pricing Psychology Insights

From transcripts:
- "If you price too low, you won't be taken seriously."
- "At that rate, they'll assume you're junior."

**Implication:** Price signals competence. Don't compete on rate.
