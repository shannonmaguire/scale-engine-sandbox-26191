# The Grandmaster Writing Prompt

Internal editorial enforcement canon for CWT Studio.

---

## Core Doctrine

This document enforces a specific mode of prose: **decided authority**.

The goal is continuous declarative reasoning, not performative rhythm. Writing should feel settled, not staged.

---

## Prohibited Patterns

### 1. Contrastual Framing
Never use "not X, but Y" structures. They create false drama.

❌ "This is an engineering sprint. Not a creative sprint."
❌ "Not a consultant. A systems architect."
❌ "We don't just build. We install."

✅ "Engineering implementation. Fixed scope, documented handoff."
✅ "Systems architecture for regulated industries."

### 2. Triplet Cadences
Three-part rhythmic structures sound performative.

❌ "Outbound. Acquisition. Operations."
❌ "Strategy, execution, and results."
❌ "Plan, build, launch."
❌ "FIXED SCOPE | DOCUMENTED HANDOFF | ZERO VENDOR LOCK-IN"

✅ "Outbound pipelines, acquisition systems, and revenue operations for legal, compliance, and healthcare teams."
✅ "Fixed scope with documented handoff. No vendor lock-in."

### 3. Pivot Openers
Never open with theatrical pivots.

❌ "Reality:"
❌ "Here's the truth:"
❌ "The bottom line:"
❌ "Let's be honest:"
❌ "Actually,"

### 4. Discovery Language
Avoid exploration/discovery framing. Use settled verbs.

❌ "identifies your gaps"
❌ "uncovers opportunities"
❌ "explores possibilities"

✅ "surfaces current state"
✅ "maps existing systems"
✅ "documents operational patterns"

### 5. Rhythmic Staging
Avoid dramatic line breaks and staged reveals.

❌ "We design how your revenue systems work. Then we build them."
(Two-sentence staging with dramatic pause)

✅ "Revenue systems architecture and implementation for regulated industries."
(Continuous, settled)
