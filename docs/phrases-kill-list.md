# Phrases Kill List

Internal editorial guide for CWT Studio. These phrases and patterns are banned from all site copy, sales calls, and client communication.

## Banned Capability Answers

Never answer capability questions with direct yes/no first.

❌ "Yes, I've run Meta and Google ads..."
❌ "Yes, we can do that..."
❌ "We have experience with..."

✅ "In phase one, I don't scale ads. I stabilize message-market fit. Ads come after proof, not before."
✅ "That depends on what the assessment reveals."
✅ "We'll know that after the diagnostic."

## Banned Accommodation Language

❌ "Not sure yet?"
❌ "If you'd like..."
❌ "Feel free to..."
❌ "We can also..."
❌ "Options include..."
❌ "We're happy to..."
❌ "Don't hesitate to..."

## Banned Flexibility Signals

❌ "We're flexible on..."
❌ "We can work with..."
❌ "We can adjust..."
❌ "Whatever works for you..."
❌ "Let us know what you prefer..."

## Banned Justification Patterns

Never explain why a boundary exists. State the rule.

❌ "Because we want to ensure quality..."
❌ "The reason we do this is..."
❌ "This helps us..."
❌ "If you need X, we're not that vendor" (contrastual)

✅ "Assessment required before Sprint."
✅ "Fixed scope only."
✅ "Existing systems only."

## Banned Contrastual Framing

❌ "Not X, but Y"
❌ "Unlike other consultants..."
❌ "Most vendors do X, we do Y"
❌ "We don't just X, we Y"

## Banned Triplet Cadences

Avoid three-part lists that sound performative.

❌ "Strategy, execution, and results"
❌ "Plan, build, launch"
❌ "Discover, design, deliver"

## Banned Pivot Openers

❌ "Reality:"
❌ "Here's the truth:"
❌ "The bottom line:"
❌ "Let's be honest:"
❌ "Actually,"

## Banned Marketing Language

❌ "Unlock"
❌ "Accelerate"
❌ "Optimize"

❌ "Streamline"
❌ "Leverage"
❌ "Synergy"
❌ "Best-in-class"
❌ "Cutting-edge"
❌ "Revolutionary"
❌ "Game-changing"

## Replacement Patterns

Instead of explaining, state:
- "We install permanent infrastructure." → "Permanent infrastructure only."
- "We don't compete on feature lists. If you're shopping vendors, you're not ready." → "Not a vendor RFP."
- "We repair broken systems. Ground-zero builds are outside scope." → "No ground-zero builds."

Instead of accommodating, contain:
- "Not sure yet? Start with our free quiz." → Remove entirely. Single CTA.
- "Feel free to reach out." → Remove entirely.

Instead of justifying, assert:
- "Because assessment reveals the real scope..." → "Assessment required."
- "We do this to ensure..." → Remove. Just state the rule.
