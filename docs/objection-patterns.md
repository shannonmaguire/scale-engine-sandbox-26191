## Pricing Objections

### Objection: "Your rate is too high"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Comparing hourly rates without total cost context
- Conditioned by cheaper vendors who don't deliver
- Testing if you'll negotiate

**Response framework:**
"You're comparing implementation cost to consulting hours. Our Sprint includes the system build, full documentation, and handoff. Their hours don't include knowledge transfer—so you're locked in. Calculate total cost over 12 months, not just project fee."

**Key insight from transcripts:**
"If you price too low, you won't be taken seriously."

Cheap rates signal junior work. Price communicates capability.

### Objection: "We need to see ROI before committing"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Need internal justification for budget
- Someone above them will ask "what's the return?"
- Valid concern, not a stall

**Response framework:**
"The Assessment includes ROI modeling. We benchmark your current state against peer companies and quantify the cost of inaction. You'll have specific numbers to bring to your CFO."

---

### Objection: "Can we start smaller?"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Risk aversion
- Burned by past projects that over-promised
- Testing commitment level

**Response framework:**
"The Assessment is the smaller start. 2 weeks, fixed fee, 100% credit to Sprint. If the Assessment reveals issues we can't fix, you've spent $2.5K to find that out. If it reveals fixable issues, you've already paid for the first Sprint."

---

## Timeline Objections

### Objection: "We need this done in 30 days"

**What they're actually saying:**
- External deadline (board meeting, quarter-end, funding round)
- Underestimating complexity
- Previous vendor over-promised timeline

**Response framework:**
"30-day projects skip foundation work. You'll ship something that breaks by Day 45. Our 90-day sprints include Week 1-2 (foundation), Week 3-10 (build), Week 11-12 (handoff + documentation). You can't compress foundation."

**Early signals in discovery:**
- Mentions specific external deadline
- Asks "can we do this faster?"
- Describes previous project that "took too long"

---

### Objection: "We're under pressure to show progress"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Internal stakeholders expecting visible change
- Someone's reputation tied to this project
- Nervous about long timelines with no interim visibility

**Response framework:**
"We deliver weekly milestones with go/no-go checkpoints. By Week 4, you'll have working functionality to show. The 90-day timeline includes buffer for issues—but you'll see progress weekly, not just at Day 90."

---

## Scope Objections

### Objection: "While you're in there, could you also..."

**What they're actually saying:**
- Scope creep incoming
- Sees opportunity to get more for same price
- May not understand project boundaries

**Response framework:**
"That's Sprint 2 scope. We can document it now and sequence it after the current engagement. Adding it to Sprint 1 extends the timeline and dilutes focus. Better to ship something working, then iterate."

**Early signals:**
- "We have a few other things that need looking at"
- "Can we add this to the scope later?"
- "It's just a small addition"

---

### Objection: "We're not sure what we need"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Valid uncertainty—they don't know what's broken
- Needs diagnosis before prescription
- May have conflicting internal opinions

**Response framework:**
"That's exactly when Assessment makes sense. If you can list your top 3 system issues AND estimate ROI for fixing each, skip Assessment. If you're debating what to fix first, start with Assessment. The 100% fee credit means Assessment is free if you do Sprint."

---

## Vendor Comparison Objections

### Objection: "We already have a Salesforce consultant"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Existing relationship complicates decision
- May be dissatisfied but loyal
- Testing if you're better

**Response framework:**
"Most consultants optimize existing workflows. We rebuild broken infrastructure—then hand it off. If your current consultant can document your entire revenue system in a handoff SOP, you don't need us. If they can't, that's the problem."

---

### Objection: "Our last consultant didn't deliver"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Burned before, now skeptical
- Want guarantees or proof points
- Looking for differentiation

**Response framework:**
"What specifically didn't work? [Listen] That's common with time-and-materials projects. Our approach is fixed scope: defined deliverables, weekly milestones, documented handoff. If we miss the mark, you have documentation of what was supposed to happen."

**Quotes from transcripts about past vendors:**
- "Our last consultant just gave us recommendations."
- "The agency built it but we can't maintain it."
- "They said it would take 6 months and it took 18."

---

### Objection: "We're talking to other firms too"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Normal buying behavior
- May be fishing for lower price
- May genuinely be evaluating

**Response framework:**
"Good. Ask them three questions: (1) What do I own when you leave? (2) Can I see a sample handoff document from a past project? (3) What happens in Week 1? Their answers will differentiate us."

---

## Internal Selling Challenges

### Objection: "I need to get buy-in from [CFO/CEO/Board]"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Not the final decision-maker
- Needs ammunition for internal selling
- May face skepticism from above

**Response framework:**
"What questions will they ask? [Listen] Let me give you the specific answers. The Assessment deliverable includes ROI modeling and competitive benchmarks—designed to answer CFO questions before they're asked."

---

### Objection: "Our team is resistant to change"

**What they're actually saying:**
- Past projects faced adoption problems
- Worried about internal pushback
- May have specific resisters in mind

**Response framework:**
"Adoption is a handoff problem, not a training problem. Our Sprint includes documented SOPs for every workflow change. Resistance usually comes from 'I don't understand why this changed.' Documentation solves that."

---

## Pattern Recognition: Early Disqualification Signals

**Client unlikely to close if:**
- Asks for hourly rate comparison first
- Describes problem as "we just need someone to fix a few things"
- No clear timeline or budget authority
- Multiple stakeholders with conflicting priorities and no tiebreaker
- Wants ongoing retainer without implementation first

**Client likely to close if:**
- Describes specific failure with quantified impact
- Has external deadline creating urgency
- Decision-maker present in discovery
- Previous vendor relationship ended for documented reason
- Asks about handoff and ownership

## Usage Guidelines

### When Handling Live Objections
1. Listen for the actual concern behind the stated objection
2. Use the response framework as a starting point, not a script
3. Ask follow-up questions to understand specific context
4. Reference past project examples when relevant

### When Updating Site Copy
1. Use objection patterns to inform FAQ content
2. Preemptively address common objections in service descriptions
3. Include differentiation language from vendor comparison section
